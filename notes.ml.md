# Python Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of science exploring methods of creating programs and machines that creatively solve problems. Machine Learning (ML) is a field with-in AI, which focuses on systems that can improve by learning from experience.

Scikit is an open source Python module that supports

* Supervised learning 
* Un-supervised learning
* Model Fitting
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Selection
* Evaluation

Scikit has the following pre-requisits:

* scipy
* numpy (installed by scipy)

You'll then install `scikit-learn`:

```sh
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-learn
```

Analysts can employ Jupyter Notebooks to organize their work. You install Jupyter Notebooks with the following:

```sh
pip install ipython
pip install "ipython[notebook]"
```

And, you launch Jupyter with the following (MacOS and Windows):

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

On launch Jupyter...

1. Instantiates a local web server running the Jupyter site
2. Launches your default browser taking you the Jupyter site's landing page

The code you enter into your notebook is Python.

Workbooks created in Jupyter are saved locally with the extension `ipynb` extension.

Work flow for a new project

1. Launch Jupyter from the commandline.
2. Create a new directory for your project in your development folder.
3. Create a new notebook.
4. Copy your data files (if any) to your notebook folder.
5. Start your analysis.

Quick review on datasets in statistics. Take the following list:

```
[1.8, 22, 33, 12]
```

The entire list is one single observation. The values inside the list are measurements.

```
dataset = [
    [1.8, 22, 33, 12],
    [2.1, 18, 30, 13],
    [1.7, 20, 31, 10]
]
```

Logistic Regression

Used in binary classification: yes or no, true or false



Supervised machine learning
We explicitly train the model.

Classification, categoric predictions, like in the Iris dataset

KNN
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest

Linear Regression√ç

Unsupervised machine learning
We have observations without answers.
we give the computer this data and it derives clusters.
K-Means
Affinity Propagain
Optics
Spectral Clustering
Birch
DBSCAN
